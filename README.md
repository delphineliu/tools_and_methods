The Shakespeare authorship question is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors, who for some reason—usually social rank, state security, or gender—did not want or could not accept public credit.(Prescott 2010)
The question of whether Shakespeare actually wrote every word in every scene of the play has circulated from the Bard's own life. The conspiracy theory holds that the playwright never really existed, or was simply an actor, not a playwright. Literary scholars have debated the possible collaborative writing of plays and who those unknown co-authors might have been.
